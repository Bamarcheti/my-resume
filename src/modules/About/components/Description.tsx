          I work for a year as a programmer. I started with Vue.js and then with React.js, in the
          Iâ€™m on we use React.js and Tailwind, some of the libs are Headless UI, react-router-dom
          and others, we also use some tools to format de code like Prettier and ESLint. I already
          used material ui and also styled-components in another project. In my project we do things
          like Payslip, Careers and website, I developed the download of the payslip to pdf and if
          also has the possibility of viewing if without downloading, I made some modals (pop-up),
          table and it also has responsiveness throughout the project.
